The rights of women information system is a web based information system targeting women and girls in Kenya. The system will enable users to search for relevant
information they want on women rights. The rights addressed will be broadly
categorized as follows:
1. Nutrition, healthcare and reproductive rights
2. Rights relating to marriage and divorce
3. Women and social injustices
4. Women and education
5. Women and employment
6. Women and property rights
7. Others


It will also enable users to click on links to other organizationsâ€™ website that may
help. Also, the system will enable users to have an interactive session with a
professional. In addition, users may check in frequently asked questions to see what
many women ask and how they have been answered. And finally, it will enable a user
to post a legal issue and allow others to comment on the issue hence get advice and
guidance. The system will be integrated with social media such as Facebook in order
to bridge the gap between the information and the target group.
